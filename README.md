# Creating Accessibility

## Description 

These refactored HTML and CSS files make this website more accessible. I have replaced all but one non-semantic elements with a logical list of semantic elements, added alt attributes to the images to provide a description for screen readers, made sure the heading attributes fall in sequential order, and added a description to the Title element.
